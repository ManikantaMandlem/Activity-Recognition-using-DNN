# Activity-Recognition-using-DNN
Real time activity detection using acceleration and gryo data from Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense


Collected acceleration and gyroscope data using Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense for 12 different physical activities

Trained an autoencoder to detect anomalous activity other than 12 activities

Trained a neural network model to detect the activity using Tensorflow

Deployed the model on arduino nano 33 BLE sense for real time activity detection using Tensorflow Lite

Raw data full data: Trained the model using segments of raw data where data is sourced from ~30 participants
Feature Extractor full data: Trained the model using extracted features from segments of raw data where data is sourced from ~30 participants

Raw data: Trained the model using segments of raw data where data is only my own personal data
Feature Extractor: Trained the model using extracted features from segments of raw data where data is only my own personal data
