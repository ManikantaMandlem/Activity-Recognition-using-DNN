# Activity-Recognition-using-DNN
Real time activity detection using acceleration and gryo data from Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense


Collected acceleration and gyroscope data using Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense for 12 different physical activities
Trained an autoencoder to detect anomalous activity other than 12 activities
Trained a neural network model to detect the activity using Tensorflow
Deployed the model on arduino nano 33 BLE sense for real time activity detection using Tensorflow Lite
